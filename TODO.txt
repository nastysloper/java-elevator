What are the next steps for elevator?
Continue with the command line version before porting it to the web, which should
be fairly straightforward.

The idea is to use some more complicated constructs. Complexity for the
sake of complexity.

I need to add some tests!

I think I need to start refactoring file names:
Elevator is an object (and so a class and file)
main should be AppRunner or something.
