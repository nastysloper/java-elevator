What are the next steps for elevator?
Continue with the command line version before porting it to the web, which should
be fairly straightforward.

The idea is to use some more complicated constructs. Complexity for the
sake of complexity.

I need to add some tests!

I think I need to start refactoring file names:
Elevator is an object (and so a class and file)
main should be AppRunner or something.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. add package

Objects:
Floor
Person
Button - Floor
Button - Elevator
Button parent class

____________________________________________________________________________________

get in elevator, press a button, ride to a new floor. Get out.

There's no concept of time (waiting for an elevator.
No threads.
No Collections.
Streams
Lambdas
Guice
